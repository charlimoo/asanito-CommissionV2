# --- Log files ---
# Ignore any files with a .log extension.

*.log.*

# --- Excel/CSV files (Optional but Recommended) ---
# Ignore any specific data files you upload for testing that shouldn't be in the repo.
# Especially important if they contain sensitive or real customer data.
*.xlsx
*.csv
#
# You have 'tests/real_data.xlsx' in the repo. If this is for automated testing,
# that's fine. But if it's sensitive, you should add it here and load it differently for tests.
# For now, we will assume it's safe test data and not ignore it.
